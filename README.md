# Sentiment Analysis using BERT

This is a Python application for sentiment analysis using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. The BERT model is a powerful pre-trained model for natural language processing tasks.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- `transformers` library installed. You can install it using the following command:
  ```
  pip install transformers
  ```

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed as mentioned in the prerequisites section.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script (`sentiment_analysis.py`) is located.

4. Run the application by executing the following command:
   ```
   python sentiment_analysis.py
   ```

5. The application will prompt you to enter a review. Type your review and press Enter.

6. The application will use the pre-trained BERT model to analyze the sentiment of the given review.

7. The sentiment analysis result will be displayed as "positive" or "negative," indicating the sentiment of the review.

8. The sentiment analysis result will also be saved in a JSON file named `sentiment_result.json` in the same directory.

## Important Note
- The BERT model used for sentiment analysis is a pre-trained model that has been fine-tuned for sentiment classification tasks. The accuracy of the sentiment analysis depends on the quality of the underlying BERT model.
